      "I was looking for halloween themed movies and stumbled over this... is there anything halloween related in this film? Seen it years ago but can't remember squat welp, been 3 years since anybody have commented Well, there was supposed to be another sequel. From what I heard, the two guys go to Italy (to meet their new relatives, I suppose) & wind up meeting Italian versions of themselves. i loved the first one is it like the first one or not?? 128238 170 7 0 7 The more things change, the more they stay the same in Wabasha, Minnesota. The uncatchable fish named Catfish Hunter grows fatter. The wisecracks, zingers and put downs pile up like freshly raked leaves. And GRUMPY OLD MEN become grumpier in the sequel that's \"pure delight, a wonderfully warmhearted comedy\" (David Sheehan, CBS-TV). Grabbing fishing rods and picking up where they left off, JACK LEMMON and WALTER MATTHAU reel in another comedy winner as GRUMPIER OLD MEN. ANN-MARGRET, DARYL HANNAH, KEVIN POLLACK and BURGESS MEREDITH also return to the Land of 10,000 Lakes to reprise their roles. And SOPHIA LOREN is the newcomer whose plan to turn the town's beloved bait shop into a ristorante sends the old boys into a tizzy. Be advised: a tizzy is very contagious. Get ready to laugh. And stay tuned for the outtakes, including \"man-sized manicotti!\" \"Better, funnier and even grumpier than the original.\"  - Joel Siegel, GOOD MORNING AMERICA/ABC-TV (c) 1995 Warner Bros.

      "So this is what my English teacher is going to make us watch What was the name of the music that was playing in the background in this Tom and Huck trailer video, hillaryannmarina? I was forced to watch this against my will The worst adaptation of Mark Twain's novel 2 ever come 2 the big screen, Elijah Wood's performance as Huckleberry Finn was more believable than Brad Renfro's \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m Ms Cervi I remember seeing this film at My Summer Camp. And Yes, I did read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer at My Middle School as Part of The Start to Finish Book Series. I remember seeing this preview on my old Disney VHS...I think it was Pocahontas. Never saw the film though. this movie \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m a \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m and i cant believe my \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m child self went to see it in theaters his (brad's) spirit lives on.  just call to him.  eeh, this is just a witch's kind of thing, though. There black man friend is missing from the film  I had a huge crush on Brad Renfro in this movie. oh ok good, so i wasn't the only one who was very hormonal while watching this movie as a 7-year-old Injun Joe's on the move! i remember having such a big crush on both of them when i was a kid <3 good times! Mark Twain must have rolled in his grave over this film. :( im only doing this because i have to Jonathan Taylor Thomas is awesome.  its hard to believe but god bless you brad :'(( Um... he died in 2008... probably you didn't know about this, I guess? WHAT?! he was like in his teens when this movie was made, and this movie was made in the 90's.  What happened? of literature that is I saw part of this movie, only a tiny amount.  And coincidentally I'm reading the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in my english class. 0:54 Tom Sawyer got \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m!!!!! it's painful to watch this trailer in general Brad Renfro... I miss u :'( Randy Taylor as Tom Sawyer? interesting.... @ 0:22 Holy \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m it's Laney Boggs! I always had a thing for huck when i watched this movie. Ahh those \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m! RIP @PanicSunday Yeah, just finished reading it and that's right on. Seems like Disney wanted to make Tom the loverboy type and Huck the rebel, when in reality they were a lot more a like and I'd say Tom was more of the mastermind. I'm such a pedophile. I'm 17 and I still think Brad Renfro is cute as Huck! 'hey becky' *gets pushed off a bridge* 'hey becky' *gets punched in the face* ah, l'amour by donn hertzfeldt, much? ;) @FromtheWordsofBR Pretty much every Disney movie ive seen had no swearing in it @coolstuff5673 There's only 3 uses of cusses! Is it me, or does this movie have a lot more \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m and cursing then a regular disney movie Cute movie. But is it just me or should Huck & Tom 's personality switch cause how they act in this movie is nothing like they are in the book. I always see Tom as the one who is leader-like. Ya heroine at age 25, so sad. Oh my gosh, what happen to him? I've been looking all over for this movie. So much better than that other one with elijah wood. And Jonathan is a cutie. 0:55 My favorite part :) \"Hey Becky\" [PUNCH!] LMAO! @townsendgirlie Me neither it would be nostalgic! <3 this movie! those were the days when i thought THIS movie was rebellious ;D @Angelmickey32 \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m no! This movie's the best! Hey! i remember this LOL!  but i was too little to see it >.< brad looks funny in this, i should see it! @SuperMetalmania666 ahahhahahahahaha love it. I was smart. I saw this movie before reading the actual books Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huck Finn. The movie didn't ruin the books, and i had the image of Brad Renfro in my mind rather than some country hick. Probably the reason why i enjoyed the books so much.  The very beginning is funny too. We saw this in English today. Huck is cute and fond of tripping Tom.  @TmSwyer: Ok, thanks for the explanation. I've just read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer but I haven't seen any film based on the Twain's book. This trailer is the first time I see any ecranisation of his works, @asmodeus585 Just completely personality wise.  Tom was no push over, Huck followed him as oppose to the other way around.  In this one they make Tom too adorable as opposed to his realistic, mischievous and romantic kid. @TmSwyer: Do you mean their looks or the plot? 'Cause even in this trailer I see scenes that were descripted differently in the book. Becky would never hit Tom. I read Adventures of Huck Finn and I'm in the middle of Tom Sawyer and I have to say, this trailer really makes them appear nothing like their book counter parts. you have a point there. See this one's where Huck's actually the right age.... Not like the Elijah Wood one, where he's like 10.... Engine joe reminds me of tenzin from uncharted 2 yes i know that, passed away is the nicer way of saying that. No,He ODed on Heroin after being relesed from prison. brad renfro passed away i miss the 90s ohmygod, it's sooo upsetting to watch this and know that he's dead ): He was truly good at what he accomplished though.  Especially in this. (: I had a HUGE crush on both of them when I was younger. aha i agree..elijah wood was awesome old skool! I remember this came out when I was like 6 or 7 155561 135 14 0 74 A preview for this 90s disney movie. From the Aristocats opening. Thanks to videos4everybody. PT1M sd\n",

New movie to watch! great thriller  saw this on vhs the here kitty kitty kitty quote was corny but awesome flick otherwise. Google:  Harry Connick Jr Weston, CT.  Learn that he's not a native of New Orleans and that he's a product of nepotism! tommorow.avi is the greatest thing ever! They don't make good movies like this anymore I love this movie. Especially the apartment!... The real author of the general idea is being shot to death by MARSHAL (judicial) in Mexico with gun by the agent I do not forget his name is Oscar Omar Ortega Vega. This passed real in Mexico. Holly hunter sexy. the one movie that still spooks me to my wits.... and i am a horror movie fan Back in time, Sigourney Weaver was, beside great acting, one of the sexyest woman alive.  Pongan el minuto 1:45 hasta el 1:47 One of the best suspense thrillers of the 90's . Sadly it was overshadowed by Se7en One of the best suspense thriller +erik karlsson the murderer is not a surprise. You see him the whole film. I love how the trailer shows the murderer... smart. This is one of those movies that will remain with you it was done so well. Unfortunately when it came out it was competing with some Box Office Sequels so it was overwhelmed and did well internationally and on rental at that time. A FANTASTIC MOVIE AND A MUST SEE FOR THE SUSPENSE/THRILLER AND HORROR MOVIE FANS!!! My JJV rating: 8/10********stars Whoa \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m chill! I don't even like DMTH Jees! Øv ville se hele filmen I love this movie One of my favorites. Loved this movie.... This is one movie that really got me scared and i am a horror movie fan.  Never, never, never, never, never, never, never, NEVER compare Drag me to \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m to Aliens or Copycat EVER again, please.  There wasn't supposed to be a sequel. It was meant to leave you with a feeling of dread. Not all great movies warrant a sequel, and I'm glad they never did one, because it probably wouldn't have been nearly as good. ma cazzarola è cosi' difficile caricare sto film ??? avra' 25 anni !!!!!!!! great movie, the year would of been sweeter had the gators win the national championship over nebraska Can someone please upload the full movie? Also like Sam in drag me to \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m. we don t care about the trailer.... we wanna all the movie !!!!! I hate this if Any moment now, an Alien is going to burst through someone's chest. I HAVE FORESEEN THE FUTURE!!! AHHHHH Good old 90's movies, giving everything away I love how she says 'Here kitty kitty' like Brett does in Alien! I want a new version of this, I now copies of other movies never gonna be better, but this is so old. I really just want the same actors and all, but just.. new. I loved it - especially the apartment! : ) I agree with the killer from Se7en. All the preperation is scarier than anything.  But Buffalo Bill from SotL is just as much of a copycat as \"Peter\". since he copied Ed Gein.  Or he's carracter is based on Gein anyway.  Not just as disgusting tho.  \"Peter\" at least chooses to copy the most infamous killers. ^_^ The concept is definitely one that seems to work and has been used in other movies as well.  This picture certainly wouldn't win any awards, but for some odd reason I enjoy watching it. Really enjoy this genre.  I can still see my mother so totally engrossed in it LOL. Hmm...a remake might be a good idea.  I for one would love to see it. \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m MUCH. To each his own, I guess. My mother was spellbound while watching this on TV.   I looked over and she was sitting on the edge of her seat during the entire second half.  Made me laugh because usually movies like this don't grab her in that way.  One of the reasons might have been that Weaver's character looked a lot like her when she was younger, so she associated with her. Plus I'm a fan of Holly Hunter.. But your objective obseration and professional judgement don't count, and you don't matter. And how do you know I live in Arizona. For all you know I could be living in Arizona.  Dude this is my opinion, and I have the right to feel the way that I do about Copycat. So shut da \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m up. I love Holly Hunter My all time favorite Sigourney Weaver movie - beside Alien! 1:42  Alien Reference 1:43 Alien reference Never get tired of watching this movie! Scariest parts are the email messages.  @bettlebag  He's also in the police station; he say's \"hi\" to a cop. I have no idea what he was doing there, though.  @Cloudberrymeadow  I thought all toilet stalls were open from the top. @anakin23  You forgot Insomnia and The silence of the Lambs!  @najhoant  Blown Away, with Jeff Bridges and Tommy Lee Jones?  @shan22044  And the trailer for Sugarcreek uses the theme from The Ring. lol. This is one terrific movie .. riveting from start to finish ... great acting .. and when Dermot's character is shot ... oh just so heartbreaking ... a classy piece of film And yes, I have seen Abduction with Sigourney. lease don;t mentiuon that. It's not even worth being called a movie. Almost Anything Holly Hunter and Sigourney Weaver touch turn to gold. /watch?v=lu7s5XfXG0k your the copycat @cotoxx22 The Police - Murder by numbers Someone knows the name of the soundtrack? Is that The Police? Thanks I luv dis movie. Dis will always in my opinion be one of da greatest movies of all times. Aliens got Sigourney Weaver this role. Why did they set it up for a part 2 at the end, yet never followed through? @Monii326 go to letmewatchtthis- im watching it right now, with one of the links lol... oh if ur a tv fan sidereel is good :) Excellent  !!!!!!!!! this is one of the best psychological thriller i have ever watch~ way ahead its time, much more intelligent than most \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m we have today. The camera work, the haunting score by christopher young and the screenplay is just terrific. But the sad thing is this movie did not the attention it deserves during its release in 1995. LOVE THIS MOVIE my favorite part is when shes like \"Here kitty kitty kitty\" Strange. The trailer for THIS movie uses music from The Pelican Brief and Interview with the Vampire...Totally not in the same genre.  @ReallyFunnyVidsNY Ok... I hope you are having a joke. If not, ana mareed! one of my favorite thriller movie..... oh Hands rocking the cradle is also good. Why cant we see those kind of thriller movies anymore!!! @blisterpacman i love annoying u people[: lol anyway idk y i wrote that... I'm looking for a movie I found in a video store once. I don't remember the title, but it seemed to be about a kind of eco-terrorist like the Unabomber and was apparently made in the 90s. Does anyone know what movie that could be? @mariopoolpoop1 and what's your point? seriously? The music of this movie is simply excellent, I hear it everyday from my playlist. It may be scarier but the killer in this movie doesn't even compare to Se7en or Silence of the Lambs. So under-rated!  Holly and Sigourney are on fire! the opening scene of this movie scared the \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m out of me when i was little, i never saw the rest of it. \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m I remmber this vid..... :s Scary \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m. Ms. Weaver is great in this movie. VERY thrilling. It got me into 'Murder By Numbers' by The Police. The music used in this trailer is from 'The Pelican Brief', another excellent thriller. Peter Cullen (Optimus Prime) FTW!!! Add more tags! It's hard to find this trailer! By the way, very nice quality. @mariopoolpoop1 lol'd. @WednezdayAddamz  what? no i remember this - god it looks old. @mariopoolpoop1 hey, is this jessi slaughter THat redhaired girl on that hippie festival scared the \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m out of my \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m i love this movie and im 11 @evanscn07 seven.... AH HA !!!  I figured out what that music is from interview with the vampire the scene when louie and claudia are on the ship after they set lestat on fire !! scary as \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m,these messages scared rhe \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m out of me! love it....great movie any more great thriller movie like this one? This is kind of like silence of the lambs.  From watching the movie you would think that the guy in the trailer is the villian of the movie.  Same for Hannibal Lecter in silence of the lambs. one of the best plots ever I was joking. Relax. Take a deep breath. I've seen the movie a thousand times. Saludos. am telling the movie because i feel like it? do you have a problem with that? cause i hope you don´t. i don´t post comments in youtube to start a fight. Harry Connick Jr is great as a serial killer. Why are you telling the movie? one of my all time favorite and a classic!!! love it!! I watched this when I was about 10 years old and since then I've felt uneasy whenever I went to one of those toilet booth-thingies that are open from the top. 330807 374 16 0 121 Trailer for director Jon Amiel's film starring Sigourney Weaver, Holly Hunter, Dermot Mulroney, William McNamara, Harry Connick Jr. PT2M1S sd\n",

      "2020 of January This is different version? 0:50 i don't see this moment in normal version of this film Just imagine a movie where Miguel Bain has the contract for Bruce Willis character in the Jackal Awful movie.  Whatever the scriptwriter(s) was/were paid it was way too much. \"A woman. It is not the same as \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m a man. You have to pull the trigger a different way.\" That has to be one of the funniest lines in Hollywood history! LOL! This movie should have had sequel one of Sylvester stallone best flim In Assassins, Antonio Banderas was a latin version of the Joker. was he hold a floppy disk? gangsta lol how to make cash the easy way /  bank / backfire / three generation strategy on making it around / adrenalina My favourite film about assassins. Rocky Balboa/Rambo vs Armand I missed the the 90's movie, they had good actors smart plot no green screen and yet best movies ever. This is how trailers should be. one of best of Sylvester action flicks 100% Dhe amount of ritually-sickled hammers he had to polish in order to get where he is, dhough... That scene where he says \"he's not dead yet\" isn't even in the picture, lol. I really loved this movie but I got really mad after I saw a scene where Dutch people were coming. I was waiting for them to speak DUTCH, and they were speaking GERMAN! There's a difference! Sometimes, those scripts are so \u001b[91m**\u001b[0m (and the writers). I hated Julianne Moore's character in this movie..otherwise decent flick! Banderas' accent reminds me of Montalban's Khan. Antonio Banderas at the laptop gif ftw! antonio banderas needs to get an oscar for his part in this movie thank you very much i was looking for it since long time, great quality 145729 227 14 0 30 Director: Richard Donner Cast:Sylvester Stallone, Antonio Banderas,Julianne Moore. Plot: Robert Rath is a seasoned hitman who just wants out of the business with no back talk. But, as things go, it ain't so easy.
