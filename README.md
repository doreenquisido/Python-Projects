**Lab 1: Python Refresher**

Introduced core Python concepts by applying file handling, BMI calculations, string operations, and basic text processing.

**Lab 2: Parsing and Text Cleaning**

Focused on parsing noisy real-world text, cleaning user comments, replacing slang, and measuring data-cleaning efficiency.

**Lab 3: Natural Language Processing with NLTK**

Applied NLTK to preprocess text using tokenization, stop-word removal, normalization, POS tagging, NER, and frequency analysis.

**Lab 4: Natural Language Processing with spaCy**

Explored modern NLP workflows by performing tokenization, lemmatization, sentence segmentation, POS tagging, and entity recognition with spaCy.

**Lab 5: Text Processing Using TF-IDF**

Implemented TF-IDF modeling to extract important terms, tune vectorizer parameters, and analyze term relevance across documents.

**Lab 6: Text Analysis Using TF-IDF, Bag of Words, and N-Grams**

Compared Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and N-Gram representations to analyze word frequency, relevance, and contextual relationships.

**Lab 7: Text Classification Using Multiple Machine Learning Algorithms**

Built and evaluated multiple text classification models using TF-IDF features and supervised learning algorithms on large datasets.

**Lab 8: Text Clustering with Multiple Algorithms**

Applied unsupervised clustering techniques to TF-IDF vectors and evaluated cluster quality using silhouette-based metrics.

**Lab 9: Enhancing a Movie Recommender System**

Developed and evaluated a hybrid recommender system by combining content-based and collaborative filtering techniques.

**Lab 10: Sentiment Analysis Using VADER and Hugging Face Transformers**

Performed and compared sentiment analysis using lexicon-based and transformer-based models with standard evaluation metrics.
